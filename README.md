They then type "npm install" on the command line to download all npm dependancies, which include Inquirer, MySQL2, and console.table. Before running the app for the first time, the user should open a MySql shell in the root folder and install the database schema file, located in the db folder. From the MySql promt, type "source db/schema.sql". The optional seeds file to give placeholder data to the table can be run with "source db/seeds.sql".
